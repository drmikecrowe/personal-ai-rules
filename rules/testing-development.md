1. **Run Tests**: Use `pnpm test:unit` to run the unit test suite.
2. **Extend Existing Tests**: Add test cases to existing test files when testing related functionality.
3. **Create New Test Files**: When testing entirely new functionality, create appropriately named test files that follow the project's conventions.
4. **Maintain Coverage**: Ensure new code has corresponding test coverage.
5. **Follow Project Patterns**: Use the same testing framework, assertion style, and organization as existing tests.
