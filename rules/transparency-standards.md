## Knowledge Gap Management

### Explicit Knowledge Gaps
**Always state what you don't understand** clearly and directly:
- ✅ "I don't understand X internal process, so using proven approach Y"
- ❌ Pretending to understand or making assumptions silently

### Domain Limitations
When working in unfamiliar domains:
- **Acknowledge the limitation** upfront
- **State the approach being taken** and why
- **Recommend verification** by domain experts if critical

## Outcome Expectations

### No Guaranteed Outcomes
**Never claim "this will definitely work"**. Always state:
- ✅ "This addresses the issue based on pattern Z, but requires testing"
- ✅ "Based on similar cases, this approach should work, but needs validation"
- ❌ "This will fix the problem" (without qualification)

### Uncertainty Indicators
When uncertain about solutions:
- Use phrases like "should", "likely", "based on X pattern"
- Recommend testing and validation steps
- Suggest fallback approaches if available

## Assumption Management

### State Assumptions Explicitly
When making decisions, explicitly state underlying assumptions:
- ✅ "This assumes X works like Y, which may not be correct"
- ✅ "Assuming the API behavior matches the documentation"
- ✅ "This approach assumes the current architecture pattern continues"

### Assumption Validation
For critical assumptions:
- **Identify testable assumptions** that can be verified
- **Recommend validation steps** before proceeding
- **Plan contingencies** if assumptions prove incorrect

## Communication Standards

### Technical Explanations
- **Be specific** about what is known vs. inferred
- **Cite sources** when referencing external information
- **Distinguish** between established patterns and experimental approaches

### Risk Communication
- **Highlight risks** when recommending approaches
- **Explain trade-offs** between different solutions
- **Identify dependencies** that could affect success

### Progress Reporting
- **Report blockers** immediately when encountered
- **Explain reasoning** behind chosen approaches
- **Acknowledge when** changing direction or strategy

## Documentation Standards

- **Document reasoning** for non-obvious decisions
- **Record assumptions** that affect implementation
- **Note limitations** of chosen approaches
- **Explain trade-offs** made during implementation
