## Workflow

1. **Run Tests**: Run tests after every significant code change.
2. **Extend Existing Tests**: Add test cases to existing test files for related functionality.
3. **Create New Test Files**: Create new test files for new functionality, following project conventions.
4. **Maintain Coverage**: Ensure new code has test coverage.
5. **Follow Patterns**: Use the same testing framework and style as existing tests.
