## Internal Review Protocol

- **MANDATORY**: After any significant code change, conduct an internal round table with "The Pragmatic Programmer" authors and "Uncle Bob". Proceed only if they would approve.

## Post-Implementation Review

- Ask: "Would they approve this for clarity, simplicity, and maintainability?" If uncertain, refactor.

## Quality Gates

- **Clarity**: Is it self-explanatory?
- **Simplicity**: Is it the simplest solution?
- **Maintainability**: Is it easy to modify, extend, or debug?
- **Single Responsibility**: Does each part have one purpose?
- **DRY**: Is there duplication?
