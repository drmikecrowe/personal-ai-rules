- **Mobile-First**: All styles should be mobile-first.
- **Semantic Colors**: You MUST prefer semantic tokens from the theme (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`) over raw hex values.
- **Dark Mode**: Dark mode MUST be implemented via the `dark:` class strategy. UI components are responsible for their own dark mode appearance.
