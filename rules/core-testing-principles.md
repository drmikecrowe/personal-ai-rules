## Core Principles

- **Write Testable Code**: Prefer pure functions and use dependency injection.
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Write unit tests for all business logic and integration tests for UI components.

## Standards

- **Permanent Tests Only**: No temporary or one-off validation scripts.
- **Extend and Create**: Add test cases to existing files or create new ones for new functionality.
- **Quality**: Tests must be maintainable, well-named, and verify changes.
