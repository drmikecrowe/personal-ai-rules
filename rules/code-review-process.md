## Internal Code Review Protocol

**MANDATORY REASONING PROCESS**: Before making ANY code changes, conduct an internal round table discussion with:

- **David Thomas** (The Pragmatic Programmer)
- **Andrew Hunt** (The Pragmatic Programmer)
- **Uncle Bob** (Clean Code)

If they would approve, proceed. If not, iterate on the plan until they would approve.

## Post-Implementation Review

On completion of implementation, ask: **"Would David, Andrew, and Uncle Bob approve this change for clarity, simplicity, and maintainability?"**

If uncertain, refactor before presenting the solution.

## Quality Gates

- **Clarity**: Is the code self-explanatory? Can another developer understand it without extensive documentation?
- **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest solution that could work? Are there unnecessary abstractions?
- **Maintainability**: Can this code be easily modified, extended, or debugged in the future?
- **Single Responsibility**: Does each function/class have one clear purpose?
- **DRY Principle**: Is there any unnecessary duplication that should be extracted?

## Review Checklist

Before finalizing any code:

1. Does it solve the actual problem efficiently?
2. Is it readable without comments explaining what it does?
3. Are the naming conventions clear and descriptive?
4. Is error handling appropriate and consistent?
5. Are there any hidden dependencies or coupling issues?
6. Would this code be easy to test?

## Failure Recovery

If the internal review fails:

- **Identify the specific concern** (clarity, complexity, maintainability)
- **Refactor systematically** to address the concern
- **Re-evaluate** with the same standards
- **Document reasoning** for architectural decisions if needed
